# About OneLife Hardcore

## Intention

This mod is intended to be played with all world settings set to default, with the exception of;

* Difficulty set to Insane
* Backpack deletes on death (This is enforced, but remains as a map icon on death until exiting the game [visual bug])

**This mod may not function properly with most other mods to the wide variety of changes applied.**

## On Death

`` You got one life! Say goodbye!``

* Your chests, campfires, vehicles, landclaim blocks, forges, workbenches, etc ...,  are removed by customly made block deletion
* Levels are reset. Deficit is removed; it wouldn't make sense anyway.
* Map exploration is reset, with waypoints removed
* Skill points are reset
* Stats are reset
* Quests & Faction are reset, the first quest in the game is given back to the player
* Journal is completely reset
* Backpack is deleted on death (Enforced)
* Some hidden respawn buffs are removed
* You are bleeding, and do not have full food or water. Don't waste time!
* Player is given back starting gear again (Based on Navezgane map)

## Misc Changes

// * Night zombies no longer die out on morning rise (untested, possibly unfunctional).
* Cannot craft bed rolls. First quest has been slightly adjusted to be completable. No respawning at known locations!
* Gunpowder recipe now requires crafting table and beaker
* Bears can climb ladders
* Reduced bear hp by 20%, and zombie bear hp by 30%
* Slightly reduced the probability of the spawnrate of birds nests


### Balancing

The goal of this is to make all skills relevant for survival. 
Things have been balanced to accomodate for the necessesity of these skills.
No longer, are any skill points wasted. Nobody said balancing has to make the game easier ...

The following adjustments have been made to the player and world for skill balancing

* Reduced the default number of backpack slots to 22
* Increased the maximum bag capacity to allow an extra row

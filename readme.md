# About OneLife Hardcore

One life is a hardcore mod where you test yourself to see how long you could survive.

Contrast to most other dead is dead mods, this one resets most things from death.

## Intention

This mod is intended to be played with all world settings set to default, with the exception of;

* Difficulty set to Insane

**This mod may not function properly with most other mods due to the wide variety of changes applied.**

NOTE: World day does not change upon death. So the more you die, the harder it gets! Hopefully you set up a base by then to compensate.

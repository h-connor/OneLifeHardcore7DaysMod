# About OneLife Hardcore

One life is a hardcore mod where you test yourself to see how long you could survive.

Contrast to most other dead is dead mods, this one resets most things from death.

**WARNING**

Be careful not to run this mod on your normal worlds. 

To know whether or not this mod is running, press `F1` when first starting or continuing a world. 
You should see `Yellow` text printed somewhere in the console saying: `WRN ONELINE: Active!`. 
This verifies that the mod is active.

## Intention

This mod is intended to be played with all world settings set to default, with the exception of;

* Difficulty set to Insane

**This mod may not function properly with most other mods due to the wide variety of changes applied.**

NOTE: World day does not change upon death. So the more you die, the harder it gets! Hopefully you set up a base by then to compensate.

## On Death

`` You got one life! Say goodbye!``

* A variety of items of are removed upon death, including their contents
	* Craftable Storage: chests, wood furniture blocks, desk safes, wall safes, gun safes, drawers
	* Craftable Stations: campfires, work benches, forges, chemistry stations, bank generators
	* Misc blocks: landclaims
* Levels are reset. Deficit is removed; it wouldn't make sense anyway.
* Map exploration is reset, with waypoints removed
* Skill points & Perks are reset
* Stats (Hp/Mana/Food/Water) are reset
* Quests & Faction are reset
* Journal is completely reset
* Backpack is deleted on death (Enforced)
* Some hidden respawn buffs are removed
* You are bleeding, and do not have full food or water. Don't waste time!
* Player is given back starting gear again (Based on Navezgane map)
* Player is rewarded with all the items required to complete the tutorial, and also given back the rewards from these tutorials.
	* In other words, you don't start with 0 exp, have 4 skill points, and have all the resources you would have needed to complete the tutorial

## Misc Changes

* The Grandpa's Forgetting Elixir in the trader now costs 7500 for cheaper perk respecing.

* Slightly reduced the spawnrate of birds nests
* Land mines damage has been reduced by 20%


## Balancing

The goal of this is to make all skills relevant for survival. 
Things have been balanced to accommodate for the necessity of these skills.
No longer, are any skill points wasted. Nobody said balancing has to make the game easier ...

The following adjustments have been made to the player and world for skill balancing

* Reduced the default number of backpack slots to 22
* Increased the maximum bag capacity to 10 items per row (50 slots, instead of 45)
* Pack mule additional backpack slots changed from 3/6/10/14/18 to 3/7/11/16/23 (NOTE: The perks description does not say this)
* Lock picks now require ForgedSteel to craft instead of ForgedIron
* Lock Picking skills % lower chance to break lockpicks has improved from 10/20/30 to 20/40/60
* Increased the breakchance of all safes by an additional 5-24% depending on the chest (Secure Hardened chests are 99%)
* Reduced the trigger delay of landmines by 25%
* Temperatures of biomes are slightly harsher
* Every biome has a 2% chance for *extremely* harsh temperatures. Be prepared or prey to RNG gods daily.
